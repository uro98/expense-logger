# Expense Logger
This is an Android app that helps with financial management. Users can log details of their expenses and see monthly/yearly charts analyzing their spending.

The app uses an SQLite database for storage and the [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) library to create the charts.
